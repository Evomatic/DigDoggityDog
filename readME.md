# DigDoggityDog - return your input string with a dog emoji!

**A utility for replacing the period at the end of a string with a 🐕 emoji. If no period, it will still add the 🐕 emoji!**

Think of something to write..

```
// I wish I had a dog.
```

Add it to the utility function.

```
const { digDoggityDog } = require('digDoggityDog');
const dogGetter = digDoggityDog("I wish I had a dog.");
```

Now you have a dog! 🐕

```
"I wish I had a dog🐕";
```
